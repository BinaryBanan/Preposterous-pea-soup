        <h1>Finnish Pea Soup: A Culinary Disaster</h1>

        <p>Finnish pea soup (hernekeitto) is a thick, green soup made of dried peas, pork, and mustard. Traditionally eaten on Thursdays, it has a long history—but does that make it good? Absolutely not.</p>
        <h2>Why Finnish Pea Soup is Awful</h2>
        <ul class="reasons">
            <li><strong>The Texture:</strong> It’s a mushy, thick, and unappealing sludge.</li>
            <li><strong>The Smell:</strong> A combination of boiled peas and overcooked pork is not pleasant.</li>
            <li><strong>The Color:</strong> Greenish-yellow soup that looks like it was made in a chemistry lab.</li>
            <li><strong>The Taste:</strong> Bland and oddly sweet, unless drowned in mustard.</li>
            <li><strong>It’s Always Served with Pancakes:</strong> As if they knew they needed something better to distract you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While some Finns enjoy this soup, many outsiders (and even locals) wonder why it still exists. Perhaps it’s tradition—or maybe they just have no choice.</p>
